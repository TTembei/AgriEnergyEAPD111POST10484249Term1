## üõ°Ô∏è Validation & Exception Handling

### 1. Validation Setup

#### a. Data Annotations (Model-Level)
- The `Product` model uses attributes like `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, etc. for basic validation.
- Example:
  ```csharp
  [Required]
  [StringLength(200)]
  public string Name { get; set; }
  ```

#### b. FluentValidation (Business/Custom Validation)
- **FluentValidation** is used for advanced and business-rule validation.
- The `ProductValidator` class (in `Validators/ProductValidator.cs`) defines rules for the `Product` model.
- Example rules:
  - Name must not be empty and max 200 chars.
  - Category and ProductType must exist in the database.
  - ProductType must belong to the selected Category.
  - ProductionDate cannot be in the future.
  - FarmerId must exist in the users table.

- The validator is registered in `Program.cs`:
  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddScoped<IValidator<Product>, ProductValidator>();
  ```
- When a product is created or edited, the validator checks the rules before saving to the database.
- If validation fails, errors are added to `ModelState` and shown to the user.

### 2. Exception Handling Setup

#### a. Custom Middleware
- A custom middleware (`Middleware/ExceptionHandlingMiddleware.cs`) catches unhandled exceptions globally.
- It logs the error and returns a structured JSON error response.
- Registered in `Program.cs`:
  ```csharp
  app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>();
  ```
- Handles:
  - **ValidationException**: Returns 400 with validation errors.
  - **DatabaseOperationException**: Returns 400 with DB error details.
  - **UnauthorizedAccessException**: Returns 401.
  - **KeyNotFoundException**: Returns 404.
  - **Other exceptions**: Returns 500 (Internal Server Error).

#### b. Custom Exceptions
- `ValidationException`: Used for validation errors (from FluentValidation or manual checks).
- `DatabaseOperationException`: Used for database-related errors (e.g., constraint violations).

### 3. Controller Integration
- In controllers (e.g., `ProductController`), validation is performed before any database operation.
- If validation fails, a `ValidationException` is thrown.
- If a database error occurs, a `DatabaseOperationException` is thrown.
- The middleware catches these and returns a user-friendly error response.

### 4. Error Response Example

If a validation error occurs, the API returns:
```json
{
  "message": "Validation Error",
  "details": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  "errors": {
    "Name": ["Name is required"],
    "ProductionDate": ["Production date cannot be in the future"]
  }
}
```

If a database error occurs:
```json
{
  "message": "Database Error: create product",
  "details": "A product with this information already exists.",
  "entityId": "123"
}
```

### 5. Summary of the Flow

1. **User submits data** (e.g., create/edit product).
2. **FluentValidation** checks business rules.
3. **Data annotations** check basic model rules.
4. If validation fails, a `ValidationException` is thrown.
5. If a DB error occurs, a `DatabaseOperationException` is thrown.
6. **ExceptionHandlingMiddleware** catches exceptions and returns a structured error response.

**This setup ensures:**
- Data is always validated before saving.
- Users get clear, actionable error messages.
- The system is robust against crashes and data corruption.
